## Qt6 module

A module for Qt6 is now available with the same functionality as the Qt5
module.

Currently finding Qt6 is only available via `qmake` as pkg-config files aren't
generated (see [QTBUG-86080](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-86080)) and
CMake support is not available for this module yet.

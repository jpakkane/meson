# List of projects using Meson

We keep a list of projects using meson, that is tested for regressions before
a release, so it's highly recommended that projects add themselves there.

If you have a project that uses Meson that you want to add to that
list, please [file a
pull-request](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/edit/master/data/users.yaml)
for it.

## Notable projects

{{ users-list.md }}

Some additional projects are listed in the [`meson` GitHub
topic](https://github.com/topics/meson).

Note that a more up-to-date list of GNOME projects that use Meson can
be found
[here](https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/GnomeGoals/MesonPorting).

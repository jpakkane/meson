description: Adds global arguments to the compiler command line.

notes:
  - Usually you should use [[add_project_arguments]] instead,
    because that works even when you project is used as a subproject.
  - You must pass always arguments individually `arg1, arg2, ...`
    rather than as a string `'arg1 arg2', ...`

    description: |
      Specifies the language(s) that the arguments should be
      applied to. If a list of languages is given, the arguments are added
      to each of the corresponding compiler command lines. Note that there
      is no way to remove an argument set in this way. If you have an
      argument that is only used in a subset of targets, you have to specify
      it in per-target flags.

    description: |
      A boolean or `'both'` specifying whether the arguments should be
      applied to targets for the host machine, the build machine, or both. If
      `true` the arguments will only be used for build targets. If `false`
      the arguments will only be used for host targets. *(since 1.4.0)* If
      `'both'` then arguments will be used for both host and build targets.
      When host == build, all options are equivalent.
